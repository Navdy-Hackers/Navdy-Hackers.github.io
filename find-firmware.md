## Finding new firmware for your Navdy display

Right now, [/u/coronafire](https://www.reddit.com/user/coronafire/) is the only person I know who releases modified and pre-built firmware for you to use.  I recommend checking [his post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/coronafire/submitted/) to see if he's released any new versions or added any comments.  You can also find his changes directly on his [Navdy GitLab page](https://gitlab.com/alelec/navdy/)! Be sure to send him a thank you, for all his hard work to restore functionality to our devices!
