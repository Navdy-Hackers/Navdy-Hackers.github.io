### OBD pins

> I’ve tried a few DIY tricks and ended up ruining the navdy and buying another one. There’s a bit of circuitry in the OBD connector and not in the magnetic base. When you bench test the Navdy with power into the right OBD pins, you’ll notice a 10v supply at the magnetic connector (pin 1&5) while pins 2,3,4 remain signal free. I tried giving a 10v supply directly to the pins on the Navdy and that led to its death! However, it still connects via USB and shows up in both fast boot & disk mode.
