## Welcome to Navdy Hackers!

Navdy, Inc. failed to become profitable and [liqudated their assets](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/navdy-contacts-would-be-creditors-prepares-to-liquidate/).  With no company backing the software and paying for certain API access, all us happy Navdy customers lost functionality in our devices.

Fortunately, some extremely dilligent hackers among us have worked backwards to learn, modify, and archive what they can to regain lost functionality!  Explore the navigation bar above to see what's possible, and who we have to thank!
